### Why?
I decided to create this full-stack web application because I noticed a lot of these workout/fitness apps are great with cool features but are not emphazing the main purpose of their application. Creating this application was a challenge because my main goal is to make a fitness tracker app but also try to incorporate a minimalistic approach to it. The UI design is completely simple and bland in order to maintain its minimalistic purpose. The blandness of the app is to make the user focus on their goal which is their fitness journey and not distract them with cool colors or additional features. The features are also very straightforward and easy to use. There are 3 different and important features that are included in this web application.

3 Main Features :
- Fitness Log
- Diet Log
- Overview Data

### Features
#### Fitness Log
The main purpose of this feature is to allow the user to keep track of their workout during that day. The user can always check their workout routine the day before and so on. The 3 main inputs of this feature are the exercise name, number of sets, and number of reps. Adding it will display a list of exercise under the inputs. 

#### Diet Log
The main purpose of this feature is to allow the user to search up the food that they consume during that day. Similiar to the fitness log, it allows the user to look at their food consumption history and assess their meal prep plan. The user can also delete/remove a mistaken food in their diet log list. 

#### Overview Data
This last feature is simple and easy as well because all it does is display the user's total food consumption. This will not only display the calories and protein but also the other nutrition facts such as sugar and sodium. 

### Tech Stack
The tech stack approach is PERN => Postgresql, Express JS, React JS, Node JS. I chose this tech stack because it is in Javascript which I am quite familiar in and have experience coding in it. The hosting website that I used is Render.com which I used for both my frontend, backend, and database. In addition, I also used Chart JS for the visual data, Auth0 for the security, and other npm libraries such as concurrent and cors. 

#### Challenges
As stated before, there were many challenges through the process of making this full-stack web application. The first challenge was relearning Express JS. It was a while ago where I learned Express JS to run the server or backend of the server. Another challenge was understanding how to make Express JS communicate to the database because I was having trouble connecting to the database and had to code the connection. Lastly, another challenge that I faced is trying to make sure the Auth0 is safe and secure for users because I would not want any information be leaked or the user getting their website hacked.

#### Improvement & Reflection
Honestly, if I have given myself a longer deadline I would be able to add maybe one or two more feature to make it better than it is right now. I decided to give myself a hard deadline of 2 weeks so that I can learn to pace my progress and learn to value which features or decision is better. Having a 2 week deadline is great but more time would have been better for the overall of the web application. Some things that I would do to improve the website is write less code. I think that there were somethings that can be done easier, quicker, and with less code. Another realization I noticed was making the backend first would be a better approach than starting with the frontend. I think I spent way too much time trying to perfect the visual of the website instead of completing the functionality of the website. Overall, it was a great experience making this full-stack web application. Learned many things along the way from the development to deployment.
